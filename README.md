## Reason for Choosing This Topic
When I first learned about Linked Lists, I found them more difficult to understand compared to Arrays because of their different structure. It took me extra time to grasp the concept. Therefore, I decided to use the circuit design skills I practiced this semester in Digital System Design with Tinkercad to simulate the basic operations of a Linked List from another perspective. By visualizing the insertion and deletion processes with Arduino and LEDs, I aimed to re‑recognize and deepen my understanding of how Linked Lists work.
